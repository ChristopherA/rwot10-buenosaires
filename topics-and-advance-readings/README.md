#  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

If you will be attending Rebooting the Web of Trust Fall 2019 in Prague, the Czech Republic, please upload your topic papers and advanced readings to this directory with a pull request.

## Pull Request Submission

To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your contribution (preferably as an .md file, but if you can't, as a PDF), along with updates to the README.md in this folder. Please also include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.

Please also enter your paper _twice_ in this README file, once in the topical listing (adding a new category describing your topic, if necessary) and one in the alphabetical listing. Please be sure to include the full URL for your paper in the README, so that we can copy it to the main page URL and have it still correctly link.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, please instead submit an issue.
