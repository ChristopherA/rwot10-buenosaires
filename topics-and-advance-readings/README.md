#  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

If you will be attending Rebooting the Web of Trust Fall 2019 in Prague, the Czech Republic, please upload your topic papers and advanced readings to this directory with a pull request.

## Pull Request Submission

To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your contribution (preferably as an .md file, but if you can't, as a PDF), along with updates to the README.md in this folder. Please also include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.

Please also enter your paper _twice_ in this README file, once in the topical listing (adding a new category describing your topic, if necessary) and one in the alphabetical listing. Please be sure to include the full URL for your paper in the README, so that we can copy it to the main page URL and have it still correctly link.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, please instead submit an issue.

## Primer Listing

These primers overview major topics which are likely to be discussed
at the design workshop. If you read nothing else, read these. (But
really, read as much as you can!)

* [RWOT Primer](./rwot-primer.md) — How the design workshop works
* [DID Primer](./did-primer.md) — Decentralized Identifiers ([extended version](./did-primer-extended.md) also available)
* [Functional Identity Primer](./functional-identity-primer.md) — A different way to look at identity
* [Verifiable Credentials Primer](./verifiable-credentials-primer.md) — the project formerly known as Verifiable Claims
* [Glossary of Terms](./glossary-primer.md) — a brief dictionary of technical terms used at RWOT

## Topical Listing

### Authorization and Delegation

[Delegated Authorization - The Alice to Bob Use Case](delegated-authorization.md)
  * by [Adrian Gropper](mailto:agropper@healthurl.com)
  * "Identity, identifiers and credentials are not an end in themselves. They are essential ingredients, among others, for practical transactions involving multiple parties. Decentralization challenges transaction protocols that support self-sovereignty for individuals in highly asymmetric relationships with institutions. The Alice to Bob Use Case merges the SSI and open authorization domains to speed adoption of emerging standards while also promoting decentralization."

### DID

[DID and the Web](DID_and_the_Web.md)
  * by [Ivan Herman](https://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/)
  * "The DID (and VC) Use Cases documents have a number of interesting use cases, from health care application to university credentials, or from corporate tax issues to travel documents. There is, however, comparatively little about what the use cases and requirements are on the relationship of DIDs (and VC's) _and the Web_."

### Encrypted Data Vault

[An Encrypted Data Vault Sprint](edv-sprint.md)
  * by [Manu Sporny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/)
  * "A list of suggestions on work that could be completed at RWOT10 to move the Encrypted Data Vault specification forward."
