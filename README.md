# Rebooting the Web of Trust X: Buenos Aires (March 2020)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT10, the tenth
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will be held
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from the evening of March 16th to the late afternoon of March 20th, 2020.

The goal of the workshop is to generate five technical white papers 
and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the 
greatest impact on the future.

## Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants are invited to contribute a
one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on
either:

   * A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
   * A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Topics & Advance Readings directory](topics-and-advance-readings) for all the current papers (and how to upload yours).
